### Introduction
This dataset captures student engagement, learning activities, and performance across academic programs and learning modes. It allows analysis of how attendance, participation, satisfaction, and internships relate to final performance and course completion, supporting insights into factors that drive student success.

### Business Understanding
Student performance and retention are critical indicators of the effectiveness of training programs. High dropout rates or low performance can negatively impact the institution’s reputation and student satisfaction.
This project seeks to answer:
*	Which course shows the highest student engagement level?
*	Is there any relationship between engagement level and final grade?
*	Do onsite learners perform better than online learners?
*	Which city has students with the best completion rates?
*	How does the number of mentorship sessions affect satisfaction or performance?
*	What can Tech Studio Academy improve to boost student success and engagement?
